      <p>There was 2 students chosen to represent their section for NSTP SUMMER IMMERSION, they had given the important information of the immersion to the whole class of BA PSYCHOLOGY 201. The representatives notified the class that eight additional students would be required to join them for the immersion. They had also informed everyone when and where the event would take place, which was originally on April 25, 2025 (Friday), at Exodus Floodway, Taytay, Rizal.</p>

      <p>A meeting with other representatives from different courses was held. The discussion concluded with the assignment of roles and responsibilities for the event.

      <h2>March 21, 2025</h2>
      <p>The meeting was primarily attended by representatives from BA PSYCHOLOGY 201. The meeting was organized to discuss the previous meeting with representatives from several courses. This meeting intended to refresh and further explain the role that had been assigned to them. The representatives had then decided to let their classmates help with event preparations, by permitting them to choose between participating through purchasing and packing the materials that will be distributed at the event, or assisting with bringing these materials home and returning them to campus on the day of the event.</p>

      <h2>April 23, 2025</h2>
      <p>A few of the students of BA PSYCHOLOGY 201 were given the task to buy the following food and drink supplies for the event: (Aqua Sweet) water bottle, Lemon Square, Nissin Wafer, and Flat Tops. The buyers had struggled due to the lack of stock for some of the items. They had, however, been able to find all the items and were able to buy them all. Although they had exceeded the limit of the budget, they were able to adapt by using their own personal money, which was later given back to them by the whole class’ funds.</p>

      <p>On April 21, students from BSCS 201 and BSTM 208 purchased the cleaning goods that will be distributed to event attendees. The BA PSYCHOLOGY 201 students were the ones who had them packed up after their class at the extended cafeteria of the STI ORTIGAS-CAINTA CAMPUS. Despite the heat, the students persisted in packaging the goods neatly.</p>

      <p>On the day of the event, all 50 participants arrived in three different jeepneys.  Following preparations, the event would begin shortly after registration.  When they reached their desired number of participants, the event began.  A skit was first performed to pique the interest of all attendees, even the children.  Afterwards, activities were played to get these people engaged.  Following the games, every participant received cleaning products and food.  Following the distribution of these donations, everyone who attended left, and the representatives celebrated their success shortly and quickly cleaned up and left the venue.</p>

    <p><b>CHALLENGES:</b></p>  

    <p><b>Time</b>- Our outreach program is a collaboration with other students from different courses. Some students can’t attend the meetings due to their class schedule.</p>

    <p><b>Limited stocks of products</b>- In terms of buying donations, our section struggled to buy food due to the limited stocks of products.</p>

    <p><b>Participating individuals</b> -  During our outreach, our supposed participants weren’t aware that we would be having our outreach, so we went house to house to encourage them to join and participate in our outreach.</p>
